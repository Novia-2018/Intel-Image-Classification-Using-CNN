<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a project made in python which uses Convolutional Neural Network to predict images according to their classes .

This model is created by few steps :

1.Installing the libraries

2.Importing The Libraries

3.Analising the Data

4.Making the functions to get the training and validation set from the Images

5.Visualizing some Random Images

6.Preprocessing the Test set

7.Building the CNN

8.Training the CNN

9.Evaluating the Model Performance

10.Visualizing Predictons on the Validation Set

### Built With


* [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/m)


### Installation

This are the various libraries that need to be installed prior
```sh
pip install sklearn
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install tensorflow

```
